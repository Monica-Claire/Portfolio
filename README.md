# Portfolio

This is the first website I have buiilt without code. It was intimidating at first. 

I started with a basic wireframe of what I wanted my website to look like, see below:

Then I worked off the above wire frame to guide the HTML base. After I created the HTML I used CSS to style the page. This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio page. I am happy with the initial results and learned a lot while creating this however I plan to continue to learn more about HTML and CSS and work to improve this further.
